## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
library('tidyverse')
library('tidymodels')
```
```{r}

```

```{r}
library(caret)
```

```{r load-data}
attacks <- read.csv("data/CTU2.csv", sep = "|")
glimpse(attacks)
```
# Breakdown the data into 8 folds

```{r skim-data}
skimr::skim(attacks)
```
# Correlation Matrix
```{r}
# Compute the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix <- cor(attacks)

# Print the correlation matrix
print(correlation_matrix)

```


# Generate random indices for splitting
split_indices <- sample(1:num_splits, size = nrow(attacks), replace = TRUE)

# Split the dataset into multiple datasets
split_datasets <- split(attacks, split_indices)
```
```{r}
# Set the number of splits
num_splits <- 8

# Calculate the approximate number of records in each split
records_per_split <- ceiling(nrow(attacks) / num_splits)

# Initialize variables
split_indices <- rep(NA, nrow(attacks))
current_index <- 1

# Generate split indices
for (i in 1:num_splits) {
  if (i == num_splits) {
    split_indices[current_index:nrow(your_dataset)] <- i
  } else {
    split_indices[current_index:(current_index + records_per_split - 1)] <- i
  }
  current_index <- current_index + records_per_split
}

# Shuffle the split indices
split_indices <- sample(split_indices)

# Split the dataset into multiple datasets
split_datasets <- split(your_dataset, split_indices)

# You can access each split dataset using names or indices
for (i in seq_along(split_datasets)) {
  # Save each split dataset to a separate file if needed
  write.csv(split_datasets[[i]], file = paste0("split_dataset_", i, ".csv"), row.names = FALSE)
}

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
