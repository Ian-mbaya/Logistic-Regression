**Project  Background**

The idea for this project is to complete a logistic regression project using R.  

The data under consideration is a labeled data set of malicious and benign attacks. The data also includes other important network traffic data like timestamps, IP address, source and destination ports, service type, duration, bytes size, and locations. The goal of this project is to create a logistic regression model that can be used to predict the type of attacks flowing into a network given some of the above noted traffic details. 

**The project includes four main steps.**

Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering - This step will involve loading the data, inspecting its structure, and other cleaning activities like dealing with duplicates and (or missing values). Other activities that may be included in this step may be type conversion, lemmatization, and tokenization of texts data if needed. This step will also include splitting the data into folds for training and cross validation purposes. 

Model Training - this step will involve building a logistic regression model that predicts whether an attack is benign or malicious. The step will also encompass hyperparameter tuning through cross-validation aimed at achieving optimal model performance. 

Model Evaluation - The third phase of the model will involve the implementation of appropriate performance metrics to determine the modelâ€™s accuracy in prediction. 

Presentation and reporting - the final part of the project will help to document the model results, strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement alongside the generation of appropriate visual aids to demonstrate results and performance.
